# Regression Template Design

This document outlines the structure, core parameters, and features for customization of the **Regression Templates** in InsightfulAI. It includes details for both **Linear Regression** and **Ridge Regression** templates.

## Linear Regression Template

### Core Parameters
- **fit_intercept (bool)**: Specifies whether to calculate the intercept for the model. Default is `True`.
- **normalize (bool)**: If `True`, the regressors are normalized before fitting. Default is `False`.

### Customizable Features
1. **Feature Scaling and Normalization**: Allows for normalization of data to improve model performance, especially for datasets with varying feature ranges.
2. **Intercept Adjustment**: The `fit_intercept` parameter can be adjusted based on whether the model requires an intercept term.

### Code Outline
```python
class LinearRegressionTemplate:
    def __init__(self, fit_intercept=True, normalize=False):
        # Initialize Linear Regression model with customizable parameters
        self.model = LinearRegression(fit_intercept=fit_intercept, normalize=normalize)
```

### Example Use Cases
- **Sales Forecasting**: Predicting future sales based on historical data.
- **House Price Prediction**: Estimating house prices using features like square footage, location, etc.

```gherkin
Feature: Sales Forecasting
  As a sales analyst
  I want to use a regression model to predict future sales
  So that I can plan inventory and marketing strategies

  Scenario: Forecast future sales based on historical data
    Given a dataset with historical sales data and seasonal trends
    When I apply the Linear Regression model to forecast sales
    Then the model should predict future sales values
    And the predictions should help in planning inventory and marketing

Feature: House Price Prediction
  As a real estate analyst
  I want to use a regression model to estimate house prices
  So that I can provide price estimates based on property features

  Scenario: Estimate house prices based on property features
    Given a dataset of properties with features like square footage, location, and number of rooms
    When I apply the Ridge Regression model to predict house prices
    Then the model should estimate a price for each property
    And the estimates should reflect the impact of each feature on the price

```

## Ridge Regression Template

### Core Parameters
- **alpha (float)**: Regularization strength. Higher values indicate stronger regularization. Default is `1.0`.
- **fit_intercept (bool)**: Specifies whether to calculate the intercept. Default is `True`.

### Customizable Features
1. **Regularization Strength**: The `alpha` parameter allows tuning of regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization.
2. **Intercept Adjustment**: Similar to Linear Regression, the `fit_intercept` parameter is customizable based on model requirements.

### Code Outline
```python
class RidgeRegressionTemplate:
    def __init__(self, alpha=1.0, fit_intercept=True):
        # Initialize Ridge Regression model with customizable parameters
        self.model = Ridge(alpha=alpha, fit_intercept=fit_intercept)
```

### Example Use Cases
- **Risk Assessment**: Predicting risk scores for financial portfolios.
- **Energy Consumption Forecasting**: Estimating power usage based on temperature, time, and other factors.

### Risk Assessment

```gherkin
Feature: Risk Assessment
  As a financial analyst
  I want to use a regression model to predict risk scores
  So that I can assess financial portfolios more accurately

  Scenario: Predict risk scores for financial portfolios
    Given a dataset of financial portfolio data with historical risk metrics
    When I apply the Ridge Regression model to predict risk scores
    Then the model should output a risk score for each portfolio
    And the scores should reflect the portfolio’s risk based on historical data

Feature: Energy Consumption Forecasting
  As a data scientist
  I want to use a regression model to estimate energy consumption
  So that I can forecast power usage based on external factors

  Scenario: Estimate energy consumption based on various factors
    Given a dataset containing temperature, time, and historical energy consumption data
    When I apply the Linear Regression model to the dataset
    Then the model should predict future energy consumption values
    And the predictions should account for changes in temperature and time of day

```

## Development and Testing

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Each template includes unit tests to verify model accuracy and performance.
- **Expected Output**: Tests check for accuracy, scalability, and robustness with different parameter settings.

### Documentation and Usage
Each template includes:
- **In-code comments** for parameter explanations and usage instructions.
- **Usage guides** to help users set up and customize each template with different configurations.
