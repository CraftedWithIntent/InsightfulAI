# Classification Template Design

This document outlines the structure, core parameters, and features for customization of the **Classification Templates** in InsightfulAI. It includes details for both **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** templates.

## Logistic Regression Template

### Core Parameters
- **C (float)**: Regularization strength. Smaller values specify stronger regularization. Default is `1.0`.
- **solver (str)**: Optimization algorithm to use in the model. Common options include `'lbfgs'` and `'saga'`.

### Customizable Features
1. **Feature Scaling**: StandardScaler is used to normalize features before model training.
2. **Regularization and Solver Options**: Users can adjust `C` and select from several solvers based on dataset needs.

### Code Outline
```python
class LogisticRegressionTemplate:
    def __init__(self, C=1.0, solver='lbfgs'):
        # Initialize model and scaling
        self.model = LogisticRegression(C=C, solver=solver)
        self.scaler = StandardScaler()
```

### Example Use Cases
- **Binary Classification**: Predicting customer churn (churn vs. no churn).
- **Multi-class Classification**: Categorizing products into different groups.

## Random Forest Template

### Core Parameters
- **n_estimators (int)**: Number of trees in the forest. Default is `100`.
- **max_depth (int)**: Maximum tree depth, controlling overfitting. Default is `None` (expands until all leaves are pure).

### Customizable Features
1. **Feature Importance**: The Random Forest model provides a feature importance score for each feature, aiding model interpretability.
2. **Flexible Tree Configuration**: Parameters such as `n_estimators` and `max_depth` can be adjusted based on dataset requirements.

### Code Outline
```python
class RandomForestTemplate:
    def __init__(self, n_estimators=100, max_depth=None):
        # Initialize model with customizable parameters
        self.model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=n_estimators, max_depth=max_depth)
```

### Example Use Cases
- **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping customers based on purchasing behavior.
- **Classification with Feature Importance**: Identifying key predictors in complex datasets.

### Customer Segmentation

```gherkin
Feature: Customer Segmentation
  As a data scientist
  I want to use a classification model to segment customers
  So that I can group them based on purchasing behavior

  Scenario: Group customers into segments
    Given a dataset of customer purchasing history
    When I apply the classification model to identify segments
    Then the model should group customers into distinct segments
    And each segment should represent a unique purchasing behavior

Feature: Classification with Feature Importance
  As a business analyst
  I want to identify important features in a classification model
  So that I can understand key predictors in complex datasets

  Scenario: Identify key predictors in the dataset
    Given a complex dataset with multiple features
    When I use the Random Forest model to classify data
    Then the model should calculate feature importance scores
    And display the top predictors influencing the classification
```

## Development and Testing

### Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Each template includes unit tests to verify model accuracy and performance with different datasets.
- **Expected Output**: Tests check for proper accuracy, scalability, and robustness when using various parameters.

### Documentation and Usage
Each template includes:
- **In-code comments** to explain parameters and methods.
- **Usage documentation** to guide users in setting up and using each template with custom parameters.
